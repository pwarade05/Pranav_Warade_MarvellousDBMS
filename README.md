A customized database management system is a virtual database in which I have implemented all SQL functionalities using Java.
- In this project, I have used the concept of a collection framework in Java to store the data.
- I have replicated almost all the functionalities of SQL programs like creating tables, inserting the data into them, fetching the data from tables and applying aggregate functions on it etc.
